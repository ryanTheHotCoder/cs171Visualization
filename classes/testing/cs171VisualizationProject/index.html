    <h2> What is Medicare? </h2>
    <div> Medicare is a federally-funded health care program in the United States that primarily services older adults and adults with disabilities.
        Every year, Medicare surveys its beneficiaries (recipients) about their demographics and healthcare experience.
        This project hopes to illuminate some trends about Medicare beneficiaries and their healthcare experience.
    </div>
    <h2> Who is eligible for Medicare? </h2>
    <div> Medicare is primarily available for people who are aged 65 or older. Provided that they are eligible for Social Security benefits, people
        with disabilities, permanent kidney failure, or ALS may be able to enroll for Medicare before they turn 65. We invite you to explore our interactive
        map to observe the geographic trends of Medicare eligibility. In America's Deep South and Appalachia regions, there is a higher concentration
        of people with disabilities who are Medicare beneficiaries, with Arkansas having the highest proportion at 19.2%. These areas also experience
        the highest amount of Chronic Kidney Disease according to the
        <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/ckd/detail.aspx?Qnum=Q705">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a> Similar to the concentration of
        Medicare beneficiaries who have disabilities in the Deep South and Appalachia regions, most people younger than 65 years old who receive Medicare
        live here as well.

    <h2> How does supplemental insurance coverage compare across demographics? </h2>
    <div> Despite the coverage that Medicare provides, most beneficiaries opt for one or more kinds of supplemental insurance coverage.
        Supplemental insurance helps cover healthcare expenses that traditional Medicare does not, for example for prescription drugs.
    </div>

    <div> Broadly, there are 4 main types of supplemental insurance coverage: Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, Part D, and private insurance. </div>

    <h4> Medicaid </h4>
    <div> Though eligibility for Medicaid varies by state, individuals who are eligible for Medicaid make incomes around the federal poverty level. </div>

    <h4> Medicare Advantage </h4>
    <div> Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private companies and they often include additional benefits like prescription drug coverage. </div>

    <h4> Part D </h4>
    <div> Part D helps beneficiaries cover their prescription drug expenses. </div>

    <h4> Private insurance </h4>
    <div> Some beneficiaries opt for more comprehensive coverage offered by private insurance companies, often administered by their current or former employer. </div>

    <div> The visualization below informs how supplemental insurance coverage types varies by demographic groups.
        You can click on one of the lighter bars to the far left to compare supplemental insurance across levels of those demographics.
        Additionally, you can click on any of the supplemental insurance buttons to decide which bars to show and hide.
        Lastly, clicking on one of the bars will show you what percent of those beneficiaries have had trouble paying their medical bills in the past year.
